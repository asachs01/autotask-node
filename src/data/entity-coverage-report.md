## üö® Implementation Considerations

### Critical Issues
1. **Company entity is missing** - This is a blocking issue as most other entities reference companies
2. **Some implemented entities not in official JSON** - Need to verify if ticket category/priority/source/status entities are still valid

### Technical Considerations
1. **Pattern Consistency** - All missing entities should follow the established pattern in existing implementations
2. **Error Handling** - Ensure new entities use the enhanced error handling from BaseEntity
3. **Testing** - Each new entity needs comprehensive test coverage
4. **Documentation** - Update API documentation and examples

### Business Impact Assessment
- **High Impact:** Company, Opportunity, CompanyLocation (affects core business operations)
- **Medium Impact:** Contract bundles, enhanced ticket management, document handling
- **Low Impact:** Read-only reference data entities

---

## üìà Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Implement `Company` entity ASAP - this is blocking full functionality
   - Audit the custom ticket entities (TicketCategory, etc.) to ensure they're still needed

2. **Short-term (Next Month):**
   - Implement Opportunity and CompanyLocation for complete CRM functionality
   - Add ContractServiceBundle for enhanced contract management

3. **Long-term (Next Quarter):**
   - Add remaining workflow entities (TicketAdditionalContact, ServiceCallTicket, Document)
   - Implement reference data entities as needed for completeness

4. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Ensure all new entities follow the established patterns
   - Add comprehensive test coverage for each new entity
   - Update documentation and examples
