AUTOTASK NODE SDK v1.0.0 PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Transform the current Autotask Node SDK from its partially-implemented state (with numerous placeholders and stub methods) into a fully functional, production-ready SDK for the Autotask PSA REST API.

CURRENT STATE:
- Basic entity CRUD operations work
- Authentication and rate limiting functional
- 215+ entity classes generated but many features stubbed
- Extensive placeholder implementations in critical systems
- No real business validation or data integrity checks
- Migration system incomplete
- Quality assurance returns fake metrics

TARGET STATE:
A production-ready Node.js SDK that provides:
- Complete, validated API coverage for all Autotask entities
- Real business logic validation and enforcement
- Functional migration system for PSA transitions
- Working relationship management between entities
- Actual data integrity and quality checks
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Production monitoring and metrics
- Full test coverage with real integration tests

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. REMOVE ALL PLACEHOLDERS AND IMPLEMENT REAL LOGIC
   - Replace all placeholder methods with actual implementations
   - Remove hardcoded return values (like 90% scores)
   - Implement real validation logic instead of stubs
   - Ensure every promised feature actually works

2. BUSINESS LOGIC VALIDATION
   - Implement real field validation rules from Autotask API
   - Add cross-entity validation (e.g., ticket requires valid company)
   - Enforce required field rules
   - Validate data types and formats
   - Check field length constraints
   - Implement business rule enforcement

3. DATA INTEGRITY SYSTEM
   - Implement referential integrity checks
   - Add cascade operations for related entities
   - Validate foreign key relationships
   - Ensure data consistency across operations
   - Add transaction support where applicable

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE IMPLEMENTATION
   - Calculate real data quality scores
   - Implement actual completeness checks
   - Add duplicate detection logic
   - Validate data accuracy metrics
   - Create real uniqueness validation

5. MIGRATION SYSTEM COMPLETION
   - Implement checkpoint save/restore functionality
   - Add real progress tracking with percentages
   - Complete ConnectWise Manage connector
   - Complete ServiceNow connector
   - Add Kaseya VSA connector
   - Implement data transformation logic
   - Add rollback capabilities
   - Create migration validation reports

6. RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT
   - Implement lazy loading for related entities
   - Add eager loading capabilities
   - Create relationship mapping system
   - Handle circular dependencies
   - Optimize relationship queries
   - Add relationship caching

7. ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY
   - Implement comprehensive error types
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Create error recovery strategies
   - Add detailed error logging
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern
   - Add graceful degradation

8. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
   - Implement request batching
   - Add response caching with TTL
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement request deduplication
   - Add performance metrics collection

9. TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE
   - Create real integration tests
   - Add end-to-end test scenarios
   - Implement mock server for testing
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Create load testing scenarios
   - Ensure 90%+ code coverage

10. DOCUMENTATION AND EXAMPLES
    - Complete API documentation for all methods
    - Add real-world usage examples
    - Create migration guides
    - Document all breaking changes
    - Add troubleshooting guide
    - Create best practices guide

11. PRODUCTION MONITORING
    - Implement health check endpoints
    - Add metrics collection
    - Create performance dashboards
    - Add alerting capabilities
    - Implement audit logging
    - Add usage analytics

12. SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS
    - Implement credential encryption
    - Add API key rotation support
    - Create security audit logs
    - Implement rate limiting per client
    - Add input sanitization
    - Implement OWASP best practices

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Zero placeholder implementations remaining
- All tests passing with >90% coverage
- Successfully migrate data from at least one PSA system
- Handle 100+ concurrent API requests without errors
- Process 10,000 entities in under 5 minutes
- All business rules enforced correctly
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Complete documentation for all features

DELIVERY MILESTONES:
1. Phase 1: Remove all placeholders and implement core functionality
2. Phase 2: Complete business logic and validation systems
3. Phase 3: Finish migration system and connectors
4. Phase 4: Add performance optimization and caching
5. Phase 5: Complete testing and documentation
6. Phase 6: Production hardening and security audit

SUCCESS METRICS:
