## 1.0.0 - Initial Release

**June 9, 2025** ‚Äî First stable release of the Autotask API Wrapper, a TypeScript/Node.js client library for the Autotask REST API.

**IMPORTANT:**

- This is a major release that establishes the foundational API and behavior patterns. Future releases will maintain backward compatibility within the 1.x series.
- The `region` parameter has been removed from configuration. The client now automatically detects the correct API zone using Autotask's zone detection endpoint.
- All entity operations support the Query Builder system for filtering and data retrieval.

**NEW FEATURES:**

**Autotask API Integration:**

- **Automatic Zone Detection**: Client automatically discovers the correct API endpoint using provided credentials, eliminating manual region configuration.
- **Entity Support**: CRUD operations for major Autotask entities including Tickets, Accounts, Contacts, Projects, Tasks, Time Entries, Contracts, Invoices, Quotes, Purchase Orders, and others.
- **Request Handling**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff, rate limiting, and error handling.
- **TypeScript Support**: Type definitions for entities, API responses, and query operations with IntelliSense support.

**Query Builder System:**

- **Type-Safe Fluent API**: Build queries with TypeScript validation and compile-time error checking.
- **Comparison Operators**: Support for `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `in`, `notIn`, `isNull`, `isNotNull`, and `between`.
- **Logical Grouping**: AND/OR operations with nesting capabilities for complex query construction.
- **Sorting**: Multi-field sorting with ascending/descending directions and chainable sort operations.
- **Field Selection**: Selective field retrieval using `select()` operations for performance optimization.
- **Related Entity Includes**: Fetch related data in single queries with field specification using `include()` operations.
- **Pagination**: Both offset-based and cursor-based pagination support with automatic page traversal.
- **Query Execution Methods**: Multiple execution patterns including `execute()`, `first()`, `count()`, and `exists()`.
- **Query Utilities**: Utilities including `clone()`, `reset()`, and `toQuerySpec()` for debugging.

**Enhanced Entity System:**

- **QueryableEntity Base Class**: Base class allowing entities to inherit query capabilities.
- **Enhanced Tickets Entity**: Integrated query builder with specialized query methods for common ticket operations.
- **Standardized CRUD Operations**: Consistent interface patterns across entity types with error handling.

**Command Line Interface:**

- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface supporting entities with CRUD operations.
- **Interactive Mode**: Prompts for creating and updating entities with input validation.
- **Output Options**: Support for JSON output and formatted table display of results.
- **Environment Integration**: Integration with environment variables and configuration files.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

**Developer Experience:**

- **Testing**: 460 unit tests with 100% pass rate, including 46 query builder tests and optimized integration test suite (11 tests).
- **Integration Test Infrastructure**: Test framework for validating against real Autotask API endpoints, optimized to respect API rate limits.
- **Custom Jest Matchers**: Test assertions for Autotask entity validation and API response testing.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking with metrics and optimization utilities.
- **Memory Management**: Pagination handling and memory optimization for large dataset operations.

**API Robustness:**

- **Error Handling**: Error types and recovery strategies for API scenarios including rate limiting, authentication failures, and network issues.

- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure storage of authentication credentials.
- **Request Validation**: Input validation and sanitization for API operations to prevent injection attacks.
- **Error Information Protection**: Handling of sensitive information in error messages and logs.

**FIXES:**

**Build and Configuration:**

- **Jest Configuration**: Resolved TypeScript compilation issues and module resolution problems in test environments.
