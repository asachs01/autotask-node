This release provides a production-ready foundation for building applications that integrate with the Autotask platform, with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, revolutionary query capabilities, and excellent developer experience.

### Changed

- BREAKING: Removed the `region` parameter from configuration and CLI usage. The client now automatically detects the correct API zone using the `/zoneInformation` endpoint and the provided credentials.
- Updated documentation and CLI usage accordingly.
- Enhanced CLI usage message to include all supported entities including contracts, invoices, and quotes
- CLI support for invoices and quotes entities with full CRUD operations
- Updated Jest configuration to properly separate unit and integration tests
- Enhanced test helpers with proper mock setup for unit tests

### Fixed

- Jest configuration for proper TypeScript support
- Winston logger configuration in tests to prevent console noise
- Unit test timeout issues caused by retry logic in RequestHandler
- Jest configuration issues with module name mapping
- TypeScript compilation errors in test files
- All TypeScript compilation errors in entity and utility tests
- Jest type system compatibility issues

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX
