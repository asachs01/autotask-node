  - Tickets, Accounts, Contacts, Projects, Tasks, Time Entries
  - Contracts, Contract Services, Contract Blocks, Contract Adjustments, Contract Exclusions
  - Invoices, Quotes, Purchase Orders, Expenses
  - Configuration Items, Attachments, Notes
- **Advanced Request Handling**: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff, rate limiting, and error handling
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions for all entities and API responses
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for all supported entities with CRUD operations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit tests (121 tests) and integration tests with real API validation

**Developer Experience:**

- **Integration Testing Infrastructure**: Complete test suite for validating against real Autotask API
- **Custom Jest Matchers**: Specialized assertions for Autotask entity validation
- **Test Helpers**: Utilities for creating test data and managing test environments
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automatic test skipping when credentials are unavailable
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Winston-based logging with configurable levels

**API Features:**

- **Automatic Zone Detection**: No manual region configuration required
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in respect for API rate limits with intelligent retry
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and handling for all API scenarios
- **Pagination Support**: Automatic handling of paginated responses
- **Filtering & Querying**: Advanced query capabilities with type-safe filters

**Documentation:**

- Complete API documentation with examples
- Integration test documentation and setup guides
- CLI usage documentation
- TypeScript type definitions for all entities

This release provides a production-ready foundation for building applications that integrate with the Autotask platform, with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and excellent developer experience.

  - Query utility methods: clone(), reset(), toQuerySpec()
  - Robust error handling and value formatting
- **QueryableEntity Base Class:**
  - Extensible base class for entities to inherit query capabilities
  - Seamless integration with existing CRUD operations
  - Convenience methods for common query patterns
- **Enhanced Tickets Entity (TicketsEnhanced):**
