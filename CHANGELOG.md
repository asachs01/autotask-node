# Autotask Node SDK Release Notes

## [2.0.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- Removed `dotenv.config()` calls from library client classes (`AutotaskClient`, `EnhancedAutotaskClient`, and generated clients). Libraries should not load `.env` files — that is the consuming application's responsibility. This caused stdout pollution with dotenv v17+, breaking MCP servers and other stdio-based protocols.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `xlsx` (SheetJS) with `exceljs` for Excel file parsing
  - xlsx had unfixed HIGH severity vulnerabilities (prototype pollution, ReDoS)
  - exceljs provides equivalent functionality with better security
- Fixed `qs` DoS vulnerability via arrayLimit bypass
- Updated dev dependencies: semantic-release, jest, typescript-eslint, prettier, ts-jest, winston, express

### Changed

- Package renamed to `@asachs01/autotask-node` (scoped)
- Package now published to GitHub Packages instead of npm
- Install with: `npm install @asachs01/autotask-node --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`

### Known Issues

- Remaining vulnerabilities are in dev/build tooling only (tar, diff) and do not affect the published package

## 2.0.0 - Production Ready Release

**August 26, 2025** — Major release marking production readiness with complete API coverage, enterprise features, and comprehensive testing.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Refactored `AutotaskClient` from monolithic structure to modular sub-client architecture
- Entity interfaces now use "I" prefix convention (e.g., `ITicket` instead of `Ticket`)
- Some entity names changed to match official Autotask API (e.g., `accounts` → `companies`)
