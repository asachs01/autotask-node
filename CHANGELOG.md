- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for all supported entities with CRUD operations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit tests (121 tests) and integration tests with real API validation

**Developer Experience:**

- **Integration Testing Infrastructure**: Complete test suite for validating against real Autotask API
- **Custom Jest Matchers**: Specialized assertions for Autotask entity validation
- **Test Helpers**: Utilities for creating test data and managing test environments
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automatic test skipping when credentials are unavailable
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Winston-based logging with configurable levels

**API Features:**
