# Enterprise Data Validation & Sanitization Layer - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive enterprise-grade data validation and sanitization layer for the Autotask SDK that provides multi-layered security, compliance, and quality assurance.

### 🔧 TypeScript Compilation Status
- ✅ All core validation system TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ ValidationEngine, SchemaRegistry, InputSanitizer, SecurityValidator, ComplianceValidator, and QualityAssurance compile cleanly
- ✅ All validation types and interfaces properly typed
- ⚠️ ValidatedAutotaskClient integration layer requires additional work due to AutotaskClient base class compatibility
- ⚠️ Pre-existing business logic and relationship system errors remain (not related to validation implementation)
