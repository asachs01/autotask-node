## Known Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **33 edge case test failures** - Complex async timing in stress tests
2. **Example applications** - 2 of 6 fully implemented (others have specifications)
3. **Performance under extreme load** - Untested beyond 500 req/sec

### Recommendations for Production
1. Start with gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
2. Monitor memory usage in long-running processes
3. Implement application-level caching for frequently accessed data
4. Use Redis backend for queue system in production
5. Enable comprehensive logging for first 30 days

## Deployment Recommendations

### Minimum Requirements
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- 1 CPU core minimum (2+ recommended)
- Network connectivity to Autotask API endpoints
